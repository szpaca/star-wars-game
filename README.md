# StarWarsGame

Using SWAPI: https://www.swapi.tech/

Build an application to select random people or starships and render their details to see
who would win based on a common attribute.

People have mass and starships have crew. A person with greater mass wins, a
starship with more crew wins.

The app should render the attributes from the resource in a simple web page that allows
you to 'play' the game.

Once two cards are displayed the app should declare one of the cards a winner based on
the higher common attribute.

Having displayed the winning card, the user should be able to play again using an action
button that repeats the same request.


## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
